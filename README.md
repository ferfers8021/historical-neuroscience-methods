# Historical Neuroscience Methods Repository

A comprehensive repository documenting and analyzing historical neuroscience experiments and methodologies, focusing on how early approaches evolved and where they were flawed or misguided. This project explores the intersection of psychology and brain science through the lens of scientific history.

## Project Scope

This repository aims to:
- Document key historical neuroscience experiments and methodologies
- Analyze the evolution of brain science from ancient times to modern era
- Highlight flawed or misguided approaches that shaped the field
- Provide context for how historical thinking influenced modern neuroscience
- Serve as an educational resource for understanding the history of neuroscience

## Repository Structure

- `/ancient/` - Ancient brain studies (Egyptian, Greek, Roman)
- `/medieval/` - Medieval and Islamic Golden Age contributions
- `/renaissance/` - Renaissance anatomical discoveries
- `/19th-century/` - 19th century developments (phrenology, localization theory)
- `/early-20th-century/` - Early 20th century neurology and psychology
- `/modern/` - Modern neuroscience paradigms and reflections on history
- `/docs/` - General documentation and reference materials

## Methodology

For each historical period, we document:
- **Key researchers and their theories**
- **Experimental methods used**
- **Major flaws or limitations**
- **Influence on modern neuroscience**
- **Primary sources and references**

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your historical period or topic
3. Add markdown files with detailed analysis
4. Submit a pull request with comprehensive documentation
5. Participate in peer review to ensure historical accuracy

## Issue Tracking

We use GitHub Issues to track research topics, document progress, and discuss historical interpretations. Each major historical period has a dedicated issue thread.

## Releases

Tagged releases mark significant historical milestones in neuroscience thinking or methodology shifts.
